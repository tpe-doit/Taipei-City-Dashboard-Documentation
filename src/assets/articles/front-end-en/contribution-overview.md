## Why Contribute

As Taipei City Dashboard transitions from an internal tool to a public platform, we hope that it can better fit the needs of all stakeholders of Taipei City.

By contributing to this project, you’ll have a say in how Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 looks and functions. This is also a great opportunity to directly interact with Taipei City Government and TUIC. Your contributions will also be attributed to all relevant components for everyone to see.

## Become a Contributor
